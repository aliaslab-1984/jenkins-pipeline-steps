Build step for launching Android AVDs - an AVD will be created with a unique name for the build currently
being executed, launched then destroyed when the nested steps have completed. The step takes a map of arguments with the following keys:

* `hardwareProfile` - the ID of an Android SDK hardware profile. Only the default SDK provided hardware profiles are supported which can be found by running `avdmanager list`.
* `systemImage` - the system image to be used for the AVD, this should be in the sdkmanager format e.g. system-images;android-27;default;x86. The system image will be automatically installed if not already available.
* (Optional) `headless` - a boolean signifying whether or not the the AVD should run with `-no-window` launch option included. Defaults to true if not specified.
* A closure containing the build steps to execute while the AVD is running.

```
node {
    withAvd(hardwareProfile: "Nexus 5X", systemImage: "system-images;android-27;default;x86", headless: false) {
        sh "./gradlew connectedAndroidTest"
    }
}
```

Note that this build step will automatically set the `ANDROID_SERIAL` environment variable so that the Gradle `connectedAndroidTest`
tasks knows which emulator to target if multiple AVDs have been launched or concurrent builds are in progress for a build node.
