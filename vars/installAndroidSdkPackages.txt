Build step which automates installation of Android SDK components either through explicit declaration or by
inspecting Gradle build scripts contained with in the job workspace.

The following components will be installed automatically:

* platform-tools
* tools
* emulator
* extras;android;m2repository
* extras;google;m2repository
* extras;intel;Hardware_Accelerated_Execution_Manager

To scan all Gradle files within the job workspace, simply call the step as follows:

```
node {
    installAndroidSdkPackages()
}
```

To install packages explicitly, just pass a list of the required packages to the `installAndroidSdkPackages`
like below. Note that package names should match the Android `sdkmanager` format.

```
node {
    installAndroidSdkPackages([
        "build-tools;27",
        "platform-27"
    ])
}
```
