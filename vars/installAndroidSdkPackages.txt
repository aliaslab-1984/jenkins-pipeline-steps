Build step which automates installation of Android SDK components either through explicit declaration or by
scanning the workspace for Gradle and Xamarin projects to extract the required SDK components from project files.

The following components will be installed and configured automatically:

* platform-tools
* tools
* emulator
* extras;android;m2repository
* extras;google;m2repository
* extras;intel;Hardware_Accelerated_Execution_Manager

To scan the job workspace for Gradle and Xamarin projects, simply call the step as follows:

```
node {
    installAndroidSdkPackages()
}
```

To install packages explicitly, just pass a list of the packages to the `installAndroidSdkPackages`
like below. Note that package names should match the Android `sdkmanager` format.

```
node {
    installAndroidSdkPackages([
        "build-tools;27",
        "platform-27"
    ])
}
```
